    </h1>

    <p>Our body needs to exercise every day and I just love the idea. I believe that your body is like a temple&#33; You
        need to watch carfully what you do with it. The way you treat it is key because you are what you eat. Which
        means that you will do great
        if you eat healty and give your body all the nutrients it needs. You cannot pretend to do well if you dont have
        good habits. Exercise is one of those habits that all of us should do in our daily basic. Your body needs to be
        active and it keeps
        you healty. Your body just need it&#33; <br> Some of the benefits are that It is good for your brain, your
        emotions, your muscles and your skin in many ways. It makes you happy and increase your metabolism and helps you
        maintaining your weight.
        It helps you handle stress and clears your brain for the day. <br> For this and some other reasons, I like to
        work out and eat healty. I dont like fast foot because its really bad for you and makes your body lazy.</p>

    <p> I like indoors and outdoors sports. Capoeira is my number one indoor sport and cycling is my top outdoor sport.

    <h2 class="hobby">Capoeira &#128170; &#128170; &#128170;</h2>
    <p>I love to eat so I need to Workout often, Otherwise, I wont be in good shape and this is really important to me.
        <br> I like to practice <a href="https://youtu.be/Kd0eP6opHcQ"
            title="Afro-Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics, and music">capoeira</a> and
        workout at the Y. Whenever I need a break from work, school, stressful situations that always arise in life... I
        just go and burn some calories. or I will go to take off with the machines or a parnet in the class. Another
        thing that's amazing
        about working out is how you feel after. Specially after capoeira, everything is just perfect. Your muscles
        could be super tired but your body never stops. You still have energy for more and your brain is in 100&#37;.

    <h2 class="hobby">Cycling <span>&#128692; &#128692; &#128692;</span>
    </h2>
    <p>I love to cycle. It is the perfect sport to do outdoors and during COVID is a good idea to hit the road. I
        decided to buy a bike and been riding it ever since until I got into an accident a month ago. I was hit by a car
        on 07/25/2020. My bike is a
        total loss and I am recovering from the injuries. I can't wait to hit the road again. I am looking for a new
        bike or I might repair mine.</p>
