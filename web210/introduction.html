          <b>Personal background:</b>
          Grew up in Colombia, studying culinary arts, and decided to travel the
          world. But first I need to learn English, so I moved six years ago to
          America and here I am in Charlotte. I am doing something completely
          different because I find out that I love computer science more than
          anything else.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Professional/Academic background:</b> I completed my internship as
          a lab facilitator (CTS) at Central Piedmont Community College. Then
          worked for the ITS Help Desk at CPCC. Now I work as a Service Desk
          Analyst at Sunbelt Rentals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Background in the subject matter of this course:</b> I've been
          using and breaking computers since I remember. I was always interested
          in IT but it was until now that I decide to study something related to
          fully understand how they work. I was thinking to get a bachelor at
          ECU but I decided not to because of multiple reasons but most
          importantly, because of money and passion on web.

          <b>Primary computer platform: </b> Windows 10 at home and school/work.

              WEB210_85: Web Design: to complete the Web Development AAS Degree.

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Something to Remember Me By: </b> I grew up in Colombia and speak
          Spanish better than English.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I'd Also Like to Share:</b> Cannot wait any longer for the pandemic
          to be over. As soon as they open the borders, I will be traveling back
          home to visit.
