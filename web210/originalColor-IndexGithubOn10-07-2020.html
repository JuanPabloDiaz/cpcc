            <div id="About_me" class="menuContent">

                <p>I am originally from Colombia, but as of 2015 I have been residing in Charlotte, NC. At the
                    moment, I
                    am working towards a career in web developing, and seek to increase my knowledge.</p>
                <p>My goals are to learn and build a career in Computer Science. I am a student at Central Piedmont
                    Community College with an emphasis in Software Development (AAS). I am expected to graduate in
                    May
                    2021. I have completed a Co-op at the Campus
                    Technology Services at CPCC and currently work at the ITS Help Desk. I possess many skills and
                    characteristics such as bilingual, disciplined, analytical thinking, loyalty, engaging,
                    reliable,
                    and self-motivated. I am seeking a meaningful
                    and challenging IT position in a structured and nurturing company that allows for professional
                    and
                    personal growth and development.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Personal background:</b>
                        Grew up in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia, studying culinary arts, and decided to travel the world. But
                        first I need to learn English, so I moved six years ago to America and here I am in
                        Charlotte. I
                        am
                        doing
                        something completely different because I find out that I love computer science more than
                        anything
                        else.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Professional/Academic background:</b>
                        I completed my internship as a lab facilitator (CTS) at Central Piedmont Community College.
                        Then
                        worked
                        for
                        the ITS Help Desk at CPCC. Now I work as a Service Desk Analyst at Sunbelt Rentals.</li>
                    <li><b>Background in the subject matter of this course:</b>
                        I've been using and breaking computers since I remember. I was always interested in IT but
                        it
                        was
                        until
                        now
                        that I decide to study something related to fully understand how they work. I was thinking
                        to
                        get a
                        bachelor
                        at ECU but I decided not to because of multiple reasons but most importantly, because of
                        money
                        and
                        passion
                        on web.</li>
                    <li><b>Primary computer platform: </b>
                        Windows 10 at home and school/work</li>
                    <li><b>Reason for taking each course:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>WEB210_85: Web Design: to complete the Web Development AAS Degree</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Something to Remember Me By: </b>
                        I grew up in Colombia and speak Spanish better than English.</li>
                    <li><b>I'd Also Like to Share:</b>
                        Cannot wait any longer for the pandemic to be over. As soon as they open the borders, I will
                        be
                        traveling
                        back home to visit.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Colombia</h2>
                <p> <q cite="https://www.britannica.com/place/Colombia">Colombia strongly reflects its history as a
                        colony of Spain. It is often referred to as the most Roman Catholic of the South American
                        countries, and most of its people are proud of the relative purity of their Spanish
                        language.
                        Its population
                        is heavily mestizo (of mixed European and Indian descent) with substantial minorities of
                        European and African ancestry. The economy is traditionally based on agriculture,
                        particularly
                        coffee and fruit production, but industries and
                        services are increasing in importance. Colombia is the most populous nation of
                        Spanish-speaking
                        South America. More than one-third of its inhabitants live in the six largest metropolitan
                        areas, of which Bogotá is the largest. The nation’s
                        political instability has been historically tied to the unequal distribution of wealth, and
                        the
                        illicit trade in drugs (mainly cocaine) remains a major disruptive factor in Colombian
                        life.</q>

                    <q>Most middle-class families eat elaborate meals that reflect Spanish and
                        indigenous traditions. A typical meal is identified by size rather than content, such as a light
                        breakfast, a substantive midday lunch, and a lighter meal in the early evening. Dinner consists
                        of fresh fruit, homemade soup, and a main dish with meat or fish accompanied by rice and/or
                        potatoes. Lower-income people eat a more carbohydrate-rich diet. Meals usually end with a very
                        sweet dessert, frequently made from panela, a type of brown sugar.
                        <br>
                        There are regional differences in foods. In the interior rural regions, a hearty breakfast
                        consists of a strip of pork, rice and beans, sweet plantains, and a large steak with fried eggs.
                        Dinner is similar, except for the eggs. In the coastal region, the emphasis is on seafood. In
                        Cartagena, the typical lunch consists of rice with coconut, fried plantains, and shrimp.
                        Colombians enjoy a variety of national and international cuisines.
                        <br>
                        Specialty dishes are eaten during holidays. A dish associated with the capital is ajiaco, a stew
                        with three types of potato, chicken, and corn, that is served with capers, cream, and avocado.
                        Another dish served during religious holidays is pasteles, while along the coast, people eat
                        sancocho, a fish or chicken stew. Colombians consume large quantities of beer and coffee and
                        relatively little milk or wine. Aguardiente combines local rum and a corn of sugar
                        brandy.</q><br>

                <h2>To Exercise</h2>
                <p>I love to eat so I need to Workout often, Otherwise, I wont be in good shape and this is really
                    important to me.<br>I like to workout at the Y. Specialy whenever I need a break from work, school,
                    or any stressful situations that always arise in life... I just go and burn some calories.
                </p>
                <h3>Capoeira &#128170; &#128170; &#128170;</h3>
                <p>My hobbies had changed because of COVID. I used to practiced Capoeira which is an "
                    Afro-Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics, and music."</p>

                <h3>Cycling <span>&#128692; &#128692; &#128692;</span></h3>
                <p>I love to cycle. It is the perfect sport to do outdoors and during COVID is a good idea to hit the
                    road. I decided to buy a mountain bike and been riding it ever since. A month later, I decided to
                    get a road bike and I just fall in love with cycing as a hole. All I could think of is where would
                    be my next trip, how many miles I am going to be able to do next time and what will be my next
                    record. unfortunately, I got into an accident a month after I got my road bike. I was hit by a car
                    on 07/25/2020. My bike was consider a total loss and I had to visit the chiropractic for more than a
                    month. I could not ride the bike while I was recovering from the
                    injuries. Once the doctor let me exercise again, I purchased a indoor trainer and had been riding it
                    ever since. now that its a little chilly outside, it is better to ride indoors but to be honest, I
                    can't wait to hit the road again. I am looking for a new bike. This probable wont happen until next
                    year.</p>
