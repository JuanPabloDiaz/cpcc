                <P>This is my one page site about me using the color scheme I created in Lab 3.</P>
                <p>I am originally from Colombia, but as of 2015 I have been residing in Charlotte, NC. At the moment, I am working towards a career in web developing, and seek to increase my knowledge.</p>
                <p>My goals are to learn and build a career in Computer Science. I am a student at Central Piedmont Community College with an emphasis in Software Development (AAS). I am expected to graduate in May 2020. I have completed a Co-op at the Campus
                    Technology Services at CPCC and currently work at the ITS Help Desk. I possess many skills and characteristics such as bilingual, disciplined, analytical thinking, loyalty, engaging, reliable, and self-motivated. I am seeking a meaningful
                    and challenging IT position in a structured and nurturing company that allows for professional and personal growth and development.</p>
                <p>Feel free to browse my workspace, contact me and ask questions if you would like. I would really appreciate your feedback!</p>

The energy of this metropolitan heart of Colombia is in part fueled by its hundreds of eclectic and authentic dining hot spots, fantastic wines, and frequent foodie festivals. Ask the locals where they like to eat, then walk off your empanadas and aji with a stroll through the historic district of La Candelaria or during an indulgent shopping adventure on the North Side. </q>                    - trip Advisor</p>

                <h2>Colombia</h2>
                <p> <q cite="https://www.britannica.com/place/Colombia">Colombia strongly reflects its history as a colony of Spain. It is often referred to as the most Roman Catholic of the South American countries, and most of its people are proud of the relative purity of their Spanish language. Its population
                    is heavily mestizo (of mixed European and Indian descent) with substantial minorities of European and African ancestry. The economy is traditionally based on agriculture, particularly coffee and fruit production, but industries and
                    services are increasing in importance. Colombia is the most populous nation of Spanish-speaking South America. More than one-third of its inhabitants live in the six largest metropolitan areas, of which Bogotá is the largest. The nation’s
                    political instability has been historically tied to the unequal distribution of wealth, and the illicit trade in drugs (mainly cocaine) remains a major disruptive factor in Colombian life.</q> - Britannica</p>
