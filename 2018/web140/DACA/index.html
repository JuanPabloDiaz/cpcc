          <h3>Why you should follow us...</h3>
          <p>
            Have you ever been in an embarrassing situation or have you had to
            deal with someone who, due to his little knowledge of the subject,
            makes you look ridiculous? Well it happened to me no far from now.
            But today this will be part of the past, at least concerning to this
            immigration memorandum call DACA.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an immigrant from Colombia, I feel identified with the fears and
            struggles that dreamers face on their daily basis. they were kids
            when they got here. DACA is a two-year temporary work relief that
            allows dreamers to be counted, to work, have a driver's license and
            other benefits I already mention in the past speech. But those are
            just a two (2) year temporary benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, with trump as president, dreamers run the risk of lose this
            benefits. That's why we all need to take actions...we all can stop
            this, actually, regardless of the congress decision, on January 18
            2018, a University study find out that 73% of American voters
            support legislation that would allow DACA individuals to remain in
            the country legally.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why today I want you to be part of that 73% and support
            dreamers who are nothing else that hardworking individuals who not
            only contribute financially to the economy, but also with their
            talents and skills, they make a better community.
          </p>

              - Would you take a hand labor job where you have to work outside?
              from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., 6 days a week and get paid $70
              dollars a day with no benefits, sick days, no vacations, no
              insurance or anything like that. And you still have to pay taxes.
              Would you take it? Well, families of dreamers are doing those
              jobs. Those that you call criminals are doing what you dont wanna
              do.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              - America is the mother of immigrants. What made you forget your
              roots? Why trump forgot his first generation who make it to the
              promised land. a first generation that destroyed many generations.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              - Now that DACA program is ended, congressmen and Senators are
              trying to explain that this is not dreamers’ fault because coming
              to the US was not their idea as child, they had no say when their
              parents bringing them. So they're putting the blame on their
              dreamers parents and I completely disagree with that, they are the
              original dreamers, who did not have a choice that cross the border
              and sacrificed everything they know so their children can achieve
              an education, giving them a better future. In fact, 85% of
              immigrants came to work and improve the living conditions of their
              families. And those that you call the dreamers are just a result
              of their sacrifice.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              - Dreamers are young people who study in american schools, play in
              our neighborhoods, with our kids and those who are Americans in
              every single way but on paper".
            </dd>
            <dd>
              - Most dreamers are under 25, the prime working age, they are
              currently holding jobs, going to school, paying taxes, and they
              are not criminals. All this to said that education is key, but
              most importantly, there is a crucial necessity in America for an
              immigration reform.

              - The US is a nation of immigrants where Illegal immigrants
              contribute to the society into multiple things, one of them is its
              economy. In which, US has a negative worker replacement rate,
              meaning america has to have immigrants. Not only for cheap labor
              but because of their contributions.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              - The best way to get control of the american borders is to
              legalize dreamers, to act, to come up with an immigration reform
              since they cannot control the black market and since ending DACA
              doesn't mean dreamers will leave america, it means they will lose
              their jobs and eventually get deported, if its happen. But if they
              decided to work under the table and live in the shadows, the
              illegal immigrant % is only gonna grow. Ending DACA does not gonna
              solve the problem, it will make it worst and heart the economy
              even more.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              - DACA pay in taxes about 60 billion dollars a year and it's more
              of the consumers benefits. In addition, if they commit a crime,
              they will be easily track that if they were illegals.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              - DACA is an act of prosecutorial discretion to defer enforcement
              action against "low-priority" individuals.” who are contributing
              to the country and the society. They are students, hard workers,
              teachers, work as bilinguals with police in law enforcement. In
              fact on 2016, the medical school application increase a 83%
              because of DACA.

          <b>Note: </b>I asked my father-in-law, who is undocumented if it was
          worth it to leave Mexico and stay in America. He said yes because no
          matter what anybody says and how hard it is to be in a place where you
          know you are not welcome neither appreciated, even if you work twice
          harder that them and because of a peace of paper, you have to leave
          with fair all your life. The reason that keeps him moving is his
          family, the well-being of his family rests on his shoulders. And maybe
          one day if he keeps working hard, their future will be secure and
          maybe one day, americans will see him with respect and as a human
          being.

              >especially the first two minutes, accurately explains what DACA
              is and why it’s important. The second half of the video goes a
              little bit more in depth about why DACA is being challenged now,
              which may or may not be appropriate for some students given their
              age and the extent of their understanding of the U.S. political
              landscape.
