	    <li><strong>Personal Background: </strong>My name is Juan (not "one"). People use to said my name wrong so if you cannot say Juan, please just call me Pablo.It is not a big deal. I don't really care... I'm 25 years old and I like sports and working out. I play capoeira (a brazilian martial art that looks like a dance but it's not). I try to stay in shape all the time by eating as healthyas possible. I love to eat. I think that you are what you eat and this influence your actions as well. Life is only one and you need to make sure you are enjoying it and taking advantages of all the opportunities you have.<br>I grew up in Colombia, study culinary arts and decided to travel the world. But first I need to learn english, so I moved tree years ago to america and here I am in Charlotte doing something completely different because I find out that I love computer science more than anything else.</li>

			<li><strong>Academic Background: </strong>I do not have much experience in IT. However I completed my internship as a lab facilitator (CTS) at Central Piedmont Community College. And now I work at the ITS HelpDesk at CPCC. I am also a full-time student at CPCC and this is my second year. I also know a little about photography, graphic design and things of that nature that I learned by taking courses, watching tutorials and searching the web.</li>

			<li><strong>Professional Background: </strong>I used to work in the food industry but I decided to move on the IT. I like to take risks in life so I decide to change my whole life and moved to america, leaving all my family back home. All for a better future for all of us. I decided to study something else and take all the opportunities america still has to success as a Web technician. I work part-time in the helpdesk at CPCC.</li>
			<li><strong>Primary Computer: </strong><code>Acer Aspire E 15"</code> with a I7 Processor and 8gb ram. It has Windows 10 installed.</li>

			<li><strong>Background in the subject matter of this course: </strong>I've been using and breaking computers since I remember. I was always interested in IT but it was until now that I decide to study something related to fully understand how they works. I was thinking to get a bachelor at ECU but I decided not to because of multiple reasons but most importantly, because of money and passion in web.</li>

			<li><strong>Career plans or goals: </strong>To get my AAS in web and maybe get another one in software or cloud. I would also like to keep getting experience at school or any other possible job opportunities.</li>

			<li><strong>Statement: </strong>I am probably not the smartest guy but I consider myself a pretty disciplined guy who target goals and don't rest until succeed. I guess it's a Colombian thing...and BTW, I don't like Colombians/drug jokes...however, they always said something about Pablo Escobar and the cartels so it's not really a big deal. It's just a bad stereotype.</li>
			
			<li>	
			  <strong>Courses: </strong>I need all these classes for my degree in Web!!
			  <ul>
				<li><i>WEB 110:</i> To fully understand the basics, master them and then move on to higher level once I create a solid structure.</li>
				<li><i>WEB 115:</i> To clarify and now how to work with Scripting.</li>
				<li><i>WEB 120:</i> To Design and create animated videos and audio in the web.</li>
				<li><i>WEB 140:</i> Get a better understanding of the web tech and develop advanced projects.</li>
				<li><i>CTS 240:</i> (Project Management) Not sure what is this class about. All I know is that is a short section and I should be aware that time flies.</li>
