          They are specially designed to integrate and present media elements.
          As an example, developers can focus more on the design, interactivity
          and functionality of the project and not waste time doing other things
          around it.

          They are easy to set up and syncronice. They are also made to organice
          and help developers in how final projects are presented.

          As I mention earlier, it purpose is to organize media and interact as
          a sequence of frames. Each frame can have multiple layers, layers
          define the stacking order of the content to be displayed. This is best
          used with animation or videos that might change over time.

          <b>3). Identify and explain the four basic navigation structures.</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <i>a) Linear</i> - means the screens are viewed one after the other,
          much like the pages of a book. also called sequential because of it
          simplicity and easy to follow one after the other.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          <i>b) Hierarchical</i> - means that the navigation is like a filter
          where it starts at the top with the most generic topics and while
          scrolling down, it filters down to more specific options. like
          grouping.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          <i>c) Networked</i> - means that users are able to explore more freely
          by replacing sequences or hierarchies with a variety of user options.
          A common example will be hyperlinks.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          <i>d) Conditional</i> - means that access to information is contingent
          on the user’s responses or progress in the application.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b
            >4). As the project manager for a multimedia presentation on student
            campus life at your college, identify the four criteria for
            selecting an authoring application and explain how each criterion
            will apply to that project.</b

        <dd>
          The <i>subject</i>, which deals with how the application will be used,
          it deals with dynamic (video/animation) or static(photos/text).
          <br />The <i>media</i>, will the media file formats be compatible. If
          not, can they be converted, easily? <br />The <i>delivery</i>, how
          will it be presented/distributed. by disk, USB or download file?
          <br />The <i>maintenance</i>, will this be updated in the future. does
          it required constant repaiers or support?
