<p>The company is a Colombian restaurant specialize in serving real food made with 100% organic ingredients. It has vegan and vegetarian options. Now concerning on the assignment, I would like to make the following recommendations based upon: what I know and my best experiences, what I have learned and what I am learning in this class, all this without forgetting my audience, my people (Young Colombians in the US).</p>
	<h2>To develop my website, I suggest the following:</h2>
	<ul>
	<a href="https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Monograma/">
					<figure style="float: right">
						<img src="https://cdn.myfonts.net/s/aw/200x200/210/0/107627.png" alt="Monograma"><br>
						<figcaption>		Feaders Font called: Monograma	</figcaption>
					</figure>
		</a>
		<li>The font used for headers will be “Monograma” because it gives a smooth and unique style to the page which goes accordingly with the type of business. I also like this font because it was design in 2012 in Bogotá, Colombia.</li><br><br><br>
		<a href="https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Muykyta/">	
					<figure style="float: right"><img src="https://cdn.myfonts.net/s/aw/200x200/144/0/73755.png" alt="Muykyta"><br>
					<figcapture>	Text Font called: Muykyta</figcapture></figure>
		</a>
		<li>The text will be “Muykyta” which is also an independent digital type design in Colombia. I am using these fonts to give the site a more Colombian style and promote the Colombian market.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Hopefully these fonts are not to rare and the site won’t look different in other devices. I will test them first and if I notice differences, I will create some graphic text and change the text to a generic one to be more consistence and have a great-multiplatform site.</li>
		</ul><br>
		<li>I advise to use graphic text for the logo, headers and subheadings. To use links/hypertext to access multiple pages of the site and some sections too as well as the external sources or social media pages. Those links could be editable text or graphic text, but it will have color effects when covering it with the mouse.</li>
		<li>This web will use HTML for the text and content, CSS for the design and graphics and JS for the interaction with the client. Later on, will use PHP to generate consistence.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>The layout will include:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li type="square">2 or 3 Headings: logo-nav, title of the page and section</li>
		<li type="square">Section for some images</li>
		<li type="square">Single description text in editable mode
</li>
		<li type="square">Block quotations for advertisement/ events / tradicion and culture</li>
		<li type="square">Three columns for page with images in each one explaining and promoting the consume of organic and real food. The vegetarianism and veganism.</li>
		<li type="square">Then the following pages will have everything about the restaurant: The menu, reservations, hours of operation and the photos of the food.</li>
		<li type="square">Note: this site will be setting up like this to create awareness because the act of eating is more than that and we should be selfish or cheap when eating. We are what we eat.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Color</h3>
	<p>The color theme will be like the Colombian flag: yellow, blue and red. Probable in a dark background. I will do some tests and see if they really work together and if not, I will pick the closest colors to kind of stay with the idea of the colors of the Colombian flat to stay in the minds of the customers.</p>
	<p>Finally, I will be using Brackets in this project because I love the functionalities, the EMMET tool and the way you can organic and view all your files in the same program. You can pretty much customize the way you want and see the changes while typing them in real life.</p>
