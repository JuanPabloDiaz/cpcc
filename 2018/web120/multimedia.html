            >1). Discuss the difference between project manager and project
            designer</b

        <dd>
          A project manager has the ultimate responsability for assuring that
          the project is in track and working propertly. The PM tasked with the
          responsibility of delivering the product on time, meeting the budget
          and delivering on promised features. They also oversee the business
          aspects of the development process, as such they must remain
          organized, focused and task oriented. Instead, the project designer is
          only responsable for the aperience and overall structur of the
          project, making sure it looks good and function correctly. The PD is
          responsible for producing the construction documents, and works with
          the PM to meet deadlines and provide them with information.

          <b
            >2). Why is multimedia development both interactive and
            iterative?</b
          >
        </dt>
        <dd>
          It is both because during the development cycle members of the team
          share their knowledge and ideas (Interactive: contributing one
          another) and changes often take place because of feedback attained
          during the development process(Iterative).
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b
            >3). Should the content expert be the client who has contracted the
            multimedia application or not? Explain your choice.</b
          >
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The client is the only one who really know what the company needs. If
          the client doesnt give a good description with all the askpects that
          is expecting the multemedia to have. The developer wont have any idea
          to materialize and personalize it. It will develop a generic
          multimedia app that the client wont probable like as much. But if the
          client is not sure about the content, they should be provided with
          help and guidance by the team members.

        <dt>
          <b
            >4). What is the importance of a storyboard in the development
            process?</b
          >
        </dt>
        <dd>
          It helps to outline media elements such as videos, photos and
          animations, by using (hand) drawings and sketches. It present the
          information you have in a organice way for you to understand and
          follow. It seems to be an extra step in the whole dessigning process
          but actually it makes it much simple. A storyboard is used to
          communicate with the client and to emphasizing project goals and the
          requirements to the development team.
