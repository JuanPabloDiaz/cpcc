<h3>Living on My Own</h3>
<p>Decisions have the power to change lives, and mine was to move to the land of opportunities. However, to make a living on my own in a foreign country was much harder than what I though it will be when I was in Colombia. At home, I started wondering about my progressing in life and if I was really reaching my goals doing what I want to do. And after long days of thinking, and actually a lot of family advice, I came to the conclusion that I was tired, I was really exhausted since the bankruptcy of my own small-business, I was destroyed. I had cross multiple circumstances, risky efforts and all my sacrifice for nothing. But after that I realised that I had to be stronger and take the right decisions at the right moment, which was that particular moment, so, I decided to let my bankruptcy go away in the past. Obviously, it shifts my course of life, and it was just the beginning, an appetizer of what I expected in the future.
</p>
<p>On the other hand while being in the US, I had to take decisions as well, indeed, more challenge decision without consulting my family, including the fact that I had to learn new things without even know-how, and to take the right direction without even know which it is or who to ask. In such a matter, moving to the US has been a profound experience in multiple aspects, such as, being an adult or at least matured enough to choose where to live, how to drive, how to budget.
</p>
<p>Especially in Colombia, I used to get immersed in my own busy life, working like a machine without even taking care of simple decision. Besides the fact that I did not have to do anything completely alone, my parents made all for me. For that reason, when I just get here, it was extremely hard to me. The first thing that I had to do by myself was to learn how to find the best place to live, then I had to evaluate the neighborhood to see if it is close to the school or not, whether it is safe or not, and if it fit in my budget. Taking my first decision, which was to live as a roommate because the rent and utilities are expensive as a single, and even more if it is close to the school. For that reason, I looked rooms in the perimeter of the city, mostly in the South of Charlotte which seems to be safe and in my case cheap. Luckily, I found a room which believed or not, I could afford it, it was in Ballantyne. While I was looking for the room, I had to ask myself if I would be able to share it and with whom I will think it would be fine, but it was impossible to predict, that was an unexplored area and I had to take the risk and see what happen, deciding in my way and learning as well how to live with strangers. In effect, I had to be careful and took the appropriate decision based on my own thoughts and perspectives of the unknown city, besides the fact to be more open mind, to be a hypocrite and to do my best trying to live with strangers. Obviously at first, it was worn and uncomfortable but after a while, when the time came down and I get used to it, they become my second family. Otherwise, I would have to find somewhere else to go and that was not in my plans (I do not recommend it because it is a tedious and an exhausting plan).</p>
<p>As a mature person who had to decide to make his living away from home, I had to figure out my own way to move around my new city. In Colombia, I rode my bike whenever so I spend some of my last saving in one bike here but it was not effective and often dangerous. Coming to the conclusion that I need a car, (thank god that I had already know some) so I sold the bike and spend the rest of my saving in my own car, a Suzuki Forenza 2007. After, I started to learn how to drive here with those rules which are different that in my city.</p>
<p>Actually, I learned it twice because I had learned in the crudest city of my country where locals are always in a hurry. Being more alert to jump on the brakes a couple times. Getting used to be suddenly cutting off, even when there was no room for it. And be always prepared to see someone avoiding signs, putting myself at risk. Under those circumstances, I used to drive with someone else who also used to tell me how to drive and where to go, basically somebody good at directions, my GPS alive. Yet here, I had to learn without anyone around to help, just my regular GPS and my sense of orientation. Making me take my own decisions fast. As well as getting comfortable while honing my driving skills doing practice in different locations and environments. And be able to use most of those useful skills to become an experienced driver, putting it together with the passive driver, who obey the rules strictly, that I had to become.</p>
<p>Moving to the US also made me learn how to manage my income and used appropriately my time. Here I have to pay my bills, my paper toilet and even my drinks at the bar when I hang out. While in Colombia, I could skip working because my dad pander me, he gave me everything even when that failure of my own bakery almost makes me go mad. My bakery “Sensacion Tropical” was my heart, the most important things that had happened to me. It made me feel realized and look the world with a different perspective. But now when I pretty much lost all and started over in America, I felt incompetent and failed. That is when my dad’s thoughts come to my mind and remind me to “do not give up Pablo, you are a champion and you always have to take risks in life I order to be successful, otherwise, life will be bored and so easy”, he said. Accomplishing sharp decisions and following my goals was not simple, I had better organize my life and time budgeting. Making a strategy including those things that I might suppose to do first in America, like learn English well which I thought would be easy. And then try to arrange everything carefully in order to make my life smooth.</p>
<p>	Generally speaking, the decision to move to these fancy country, forced me to live on my own, and it makes me learn different challenging experiences with every step I go. It also made me accomplish more targets by myself, becoming more independence and secure of me, following my instinct to keep the right direction with intelligent movement that help me to grow up and overcome the past as well as figure out me and my shadow how to live, to drive and to budget money and time in the US. And finally, it makes the person who I am, a more mature person than I was in Colombia.</p>
