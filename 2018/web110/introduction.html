          <strong>Personal Background: </strong>My name is Juan (not "one").
          People use to said my name wrong so if you cannot say Juan, please
          just call me Pablo.It is not a big deal. I don't really care... I'm 25
          years old and I like sports and working out. I play capoeira (a
          brazilian martial art that looks like a dance but it's not). I try to
          stay in shape all the time by eating as healthyas possible. I love to
          eat. I think that you are what you eat and this influence your actions
          as well. Life is only one and you need to make sure you are enjoying
          it and taking advantages of all the opportunities you have.<br />I
          grew up in Colombia, study culinary arts and decided to travel the
          world. But first I need to learn english, so I moved tree years ago to
          america and here I am in Charlotte doing something completely
          different because I find out that I love computer science more than
          anything else.

          <strong>Academic Background: </strong>I do not have much experience in
          IT. However I completed my internship as a lab facilitator (CTS) at
          Central Piedmont Community College. And now I work at the ITS HelpDesk
          at CPCC. I am also a full-time student at CPCC and this is my second
          year. I also know a little about photography, graphic design and
          things of that nature that I learned by taking courses, watching
          tutorials and searching the web.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Professional Background: </strong>I used to work in the food
          industry but I decided to move on the IT. I like to take risks in life
          so I decide to change my whole life and moved to america, leaving all
          my family back home. All for a better future for all of us. I decided
          to study something else and take all the opportunities america still
          has to success as a Web technician. I work part-time in the helpdesk
          at CPCC.

          <strong>Primary Computer: </strong><code>Acer Aspire E 15"</code> with
          a I7 Processor and 8gb ram. It has Windows 10 installed.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Background in the subject matter of this course: </strong>I've
          been using and breaking computers since I remember. I was always
          interested in IT but it was until now that I decide to study something
          related to fully understand how they works. I was thinking to get a
          bachelor at ECU but I decided not to because of multiple reasons but
          most importantly, because of money and passion in web.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Career plans or goals: </strong>To get my AAS in web and maybe
          get another one in software or cloud. I would also like to keep
          getting experience at school or any other possible job opportunities.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Statement: </strong>I am probably not the smartest guy but I
          consider myself a pretty disciplined guy who target goals and don't
          rest until succeed. I guess it's a Colombian thing...and BTW, I don't
          like Colombians/drug jokes...however, they always said something about
          Pablo Escobar and the cartels so it's not really a big deal. It's just
          a bad stereotype.
        </li>
