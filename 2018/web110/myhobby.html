		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>
			 I believe that your body is like a temple&#33; You need to watch carfully what you do with it. The way you treat it is key because you are what you eat. Which means that you will do great if you eat healty and give your body all the nutrients it needs. You cannot pretend to do well if you dont have good habits. Exercise is one of those habits that all of us should do in our daily basic. Your body needs to be active and it keeps you healty. Your body just need it&#33; <br>
			 Some of the benefits are that It is good for your brain, your emotions, your muscles and your skin in many ways. It makes you happy and increase your metabolism and helps you maintaining your weight. It helps you handle stress and clears your brain for the day. <br>
			 For this and some other reasons, I like to work out and eat healty. I dont like fast foot because its really bad for you and makes your body lazy.</p>
      <h2>Why Capoeira?</h2>
			 <p>I love to eat so I need to Workout often, Otherwise, I wont be in good shape and this is really important to me. <br>
			 I like to relax practing <a href="https://youtu.be/Kd0eP6opHcQ" title="Afro-Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics, and music">capoeira</a> or going to the gym. Whenever I need a break from work, school, stressful situations that always arise in life... I just go and burn some calories. or I will go to take off with the machines or a parnet in the class. Another thing that's amazing about working out is how you feel after. Specially after capoeira, everything is just perfect. Your muscles could be super tired but your body never stops. You still have energy for more and your brain is in 100&#37;. &#45; Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5dW8ngU-z0&list=RDl5dW8ngU-z0&start_radio=1&t=21" target="_blank">here</a> to watch more videos about capoeira.
