          <strong>Do you believe the site reaches its audience? </strong><br />
          Definitely, it's a pretty cool website that has a lot of fancy tools
          and features with a nice design. their blogs have some comments and
          the social sites have a large number of followers. In fact, only
          Facebook has 50,807 people who like it
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Was this site useful to you? Why or why not?</strong><br />
          Yes!! It has tons of information, useful articles and multiple links
          such as templates, ebooks, forum, blogs, jobs and further information.
          In addition, this website inspired me to learn more about web and one
          day, not far from now, I will be able to create a website just like
          this or even better.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >List the colors and/or graphics that are used on the home page of
            this website: background, backgrounds of page sections, text, logo,
            navigation buttons, and so on</strong
          >
          <ul>
            <li>
              They use simple colors like background: black; text: white and
              gray; however, there are sections in the web that change to
              background: gray or pink or white; and text: black; In fact, the
              entire web changes and interact with the client.
            </li>
            <li>
              it has a black and gray horizontal navigation bar, which shows a
              dropdown menu with further information about the site
            </li>
            <li>
              The company logo is well-design after the same flow of the
              website. it even works as a clickable link to the home page.
            </li>
            <li>The text is clear and seems to have a showdown.</li>
            <li>
              the first section of the web in the home page has a video-loop in
              the background that gives a plus to the site since it makes it
              more attractive and interactive to the user
            </li>
            <li>
              Some of the images also works as animations while scrolling down
              the site. But not just the images, it seems that the entire site
              changes everything while scrolling down which is pretty
              impressive. all the content change. I believe this is javascript
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >How do the use of graphics and color enhance the website?</strong
          ><br />
          They create a perfect flow in the website. The graphics are pretty
          well-design. They help a lot interacting with the client and drawing
          attention from beginning to end. the Javascript help a lot and makes
          the website more pleasant to watch. It makes me curious and wonder
          what else can I find, where to explore and it keeps me scrolling down.
