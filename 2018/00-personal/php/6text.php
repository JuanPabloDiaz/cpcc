				<li><i>Bitmapped fonts</i> works like vectors which means that are created pixel by pixel. Making them like a picture which you can change the size by simple drag and drop the width.</li>
				<li><i>Outline fonts</i> does not required large storage since files are small.</li>
				<li><i>Legibility</i> measure if reader can read the text and use techniques to make letter easy to read creating a flow and ideal shapes. It focus on the flow of single letters and then the entire text as a whole.</li>
				<li><i>Readablility</i> measure how much the reader want to read the text by playing with the style of the whole page where its displayed. Adding images, central paragraphs in different sizes or capital letters to enfasize and change focus to relax client. </li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><b>Cons...</b>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Bitmapped font</i> needs a particular software to edit and are heavy files which means thta requires large storage capacity.</li>
				<li><i>Outline fonts</i> they are not universal and font are controled by licenses.</li>
				<li><i>Legibility</i> depends on the judgement of the designer and is not standared, well there are default sizes and measures but it change from person to person.</li>

	<li><b>What is the problem of installed fonts? How can multimedia developers resolve this problem?</b> They are not standar and will look different depending on the device or even the program where its louding the web. It can be solve by simple using the common/widely available fonts that any computer has by default or attaching the link or package the fonts in use with the application. </li>
