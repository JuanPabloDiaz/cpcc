<h2>Juan D&iacute;az Course Contract WEB 140</h2> 
	
<p> I, Juan D&iacute;az, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall WEB140-85:Web Development Tools with my instructor, Jennifer Coleman.</p>
<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

<h3>Workspace Setup</h3>

<p>Here is an embedded screenshot of my workspace setup. I've highlighted the important parts, and cropped and sized the image appropriately. Click the image for a link to the original. Both files are stored and named appropriately in my images folder inside this course's folder</p>
