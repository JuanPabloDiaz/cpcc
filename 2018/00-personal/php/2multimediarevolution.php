    <strong>Identify the pioneers in multimedia computing and list the main contributions of each.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Vannevar bush:</i> (theorists) He develop a “Differential Analyzer” - analog computer. Also proposed several multimedia devices to solve human limitations such as memory (data recovery) with Memex I and II. He was well recognized on the way his machines could improve the way to recovery and use information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Alan turing:</i>  (theorists) He contributed developing what we know as modern computer. His contribution was more theoretical / practical defining what is an “effective procedure”. Develop an abstract machine know as “Turing machine”. He states that effective procedure and turing machine means the same and if we as humans can think and resolve a problem, computer can do it to. He is also known for the turing test.

          <i>Douglas engelbart:</i> increase human interaction with the innovation of the first computer mouse
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Alan kay:</i> she developed the Dynabook machine: "A personal computer for children of all ages" focussion more in the way people learn, visualize and create. He developed a user interface more people friendly know as a graphical user interface (GUI).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Steve jobs:</i> he believed that one day people will be able to use computers without knowing coding. His macintosh idea was a huge change in computers. He makes things way easier thanks to its graphic design (other futures too) and it was the first mass produced computer. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Tim berners-lee:</i> invented the WWW, developing the world's first web server. He develop the “first communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet”

    <strong>What is the essential difference between interactive and non-interactive multimedia? Give an example of each type.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-interactive: </strong> When client is an observer of information. he/she does not have any control over the media</li>
        <ul>
          <li><i>An example could be…</i> TV or a video, which its pretty much non interactive if the client is only able to play, pause and stop video.
          </li>
          <li><i>Another example</i> is a presentation in which the client see their point and the problem but cant interact solving the walk around.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive: </strong> When client is a participant in the flow of information, the user can be part and solve/test their knowledge.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Example:</i> For an interactive media could be also a video but this time with clickable links.
          </li>
          <li>Now with the same presentation that has an additional tool such as the drag and drop exercise in which the client can test their knowledge to ensure is getting the right information.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
  </li>

    <strong>Why are media professionals building their careers with digital technology?</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Because digital multimedia is changing the world by making the impossible, possible in this days. Now our phones are computers integrated with camara, text, animation, sound and other capabilities that makes our daily tasks more efficiently and economics. Our lives are more simple by using the digital technology tools such as computers, phones, and other integrated devices capable of multi task setting for efficiently.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Why is hypermedia a more advanced form of interactive multimedia?</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>It is a more complex structure of information, where you can find multiple elements such as links, text, data, graphics, audio and video. In which all elements are linked and the user can move around easily. Its an extension of hypertext and a nonlinear medium of information.</li>
