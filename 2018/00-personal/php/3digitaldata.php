    <strong>Why is file compatibility important for multimedia development?</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Because developers need to be able to move and work with files with multiple applications. The file should work in different devices and platforms such as windows, ios, android, chromebooks. This will also ensure that the client will be able to see the file in multiple devices no matter the hardware in use. But pretty much it's more for the developer perspective because they use multiple softwares to edit files, they could be using photoshop to edit the pixels of a photo, then lightroom for the tonal curves, black and white conversion and so many softwares to come up with a decent professional photo.

  	<strong>Identify and describe two advantages and two challenges in the use of digital information.</strong>
  	<ul>
      <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
       	<ul>
       		<li>It is super easy and super effective to edit data and manipulate digital information.</li>
       		<li>A single computer can multitask without slowing down the performance. You can be working on a word document while searching in the internet or be listening to your favorite music.</li>
       		<li>Videos, music and files are also easier to move and copy in digital format than analogic. You will be missing less/none of the quality of the file.</li>
       		<li>Photos and images are easy to edit in a digital format. They are also inexpensive and availables in multiple platforms which means that you can edit them no matter what device you are using. Instead of the analog version that will slow down you device (if it can handle the format) and will cost you more.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
     	<li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong>
       	<ul>
       		<li>Longevity and security of the digital media are big concerns. Files in this format depends directly of the hardware that they are stored. If it breaks, the information is not longer available. In fact, its recommended to use tapes and SSD to store important digital files since the hardware does not have any moving parts that might break over the years.</li>
       		<li>Digital files also demand better devices with largest processors and bigger storage space. And in some cases, the file type (extension) that you are using in one device is not compatible with other devices or applications.</li>
       	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>What are the main considerations for file maintenance?</strong>
		<ul>
      <li>identification (such as standar extensions), categorization (increase performance) and preservation (backup storage in multiple locations).</li>
    </ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>How does MP3 maintain audio quality while also significantly reducing file sizes? Explain two specific strategies.</strong>
		<ul>
      <li>Its capable of a technology that analyse the sound file and discard the corrupted data. In other words, the data that is not really important or critical for a high quality performance that looks similar as the CD-quality performance.</li>
    </ul>
